jQuery JavaScript Gallery plugin extending NextGen Gallery's slideshow abilities without breakage. Uses GalleryView - jQuery Content Gallery Plugin by [Jack Anderson](http://www.spaceforaname.com/galleryview/).

== Description ==

**Nextgen GalleryView**: A Wordpress Plugin that allows you to use the jQuery GalleryView Plugin with your **NextGen-Gallery** galleries.

In order to use the GalleryView Plugin you kinda need to be using [NextGen Gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/).

You can see it live on my woodworking portfolio [John Brien Modern Woodworks](http://jbmodernwoodworks.com/).
You can read about it on my blog of rants [John Brien](http://blog.hybridindie.com/)

== Installation == 

First have [NextGen Gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) installed and working
Install [WordPress-Nextgen-GalleryView](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-nextgen-galleryview)
Set the Defaults under the GalleryView Menu

Please be aware that if you are upgrading, your shortcodes from the previous versions will not work. Theme developers using the raw code in their themes you will have to do an update as well. I do apologize for this but there were issues with the syntax causing problems and I have more plans for this plugin moving forward. This is for the best, you won't be disappointed moving forward I promise.
